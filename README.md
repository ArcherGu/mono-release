pnpm add mono-release -D
```

**NOTE**: You may need to add `-W` flag to install it in a monorepo workspace.

## Usage

Use directly: 
```shell
npx mono-release
# Or
npx mor
```
Or through a script in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "mono-release"
  }
}
```

### Publish
It also provides a command for publishing packages:
```shell
npx mono-release publish bar@0.0.1
```
The tag format must be: `<pkg>@<version>`.


## Configuration
You can add a "mono-release" key to `package.json` to add configuration for it:
```json
{
  "mono-release": {
    "packagesPath": "packages-path",
    "exclude": ["pkg-will-not-be-released"],
    "changelog": true,
    "dry": false,
    "push": true
  }
}
```
`mono-release.config.ts` (`'.js' | '.cjs' | '.mjs' | '.json'`) is also available:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'mono-release'

export default defineConfig({
  packagesPath: 'packages-path',
  exclude: ['pkg-will-not-be-released'],
  changelog: true,
  dry: false,
  push: true
})
```
**NOTE**: You need to install [conventional-changelog-cli](https://npm.im/conventional-changelog-cli) to generate changelog.

## How it works

When you need release a package from monorepo project, you can run this tool to execute a command-line script, which you can select the package that needs to release and select a recommended version. It will automatically generate a commit message about this release, and push this commit. In addition, a tag about this version will also be pushed.

 Much of the code for this tool references [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)'s [release scripts](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/scripts). You can observe the details of its release to understand more how it works

***NOTE**: If you have any uncommited changes, you will be prompted to commit them before you run this tool.*
